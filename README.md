# 🐱 React Cat Card Profiles

This is a mini React project created as part of my early practice while learning React.  
The app displays cat profile cards, each showing a cat's name, image, email, and phone number. The profile data is stored in a separate JavaScript file and rendered using `.map()`.

## 🚀 Project Overview

> A small component-based application that renders multiple cat profile cards using props and object destructuring.

Each profile card is built using a reusable `Card` component. The data is imported and mapped over to dynamically generate the cards.

## 🧠 Purpose

This mini project was built to:
- Practice breaking UI into **components**
- Learn how to **pass props**
- Use **object destructuring** in component parameters
- Work with **lists** and the `.map()` method in React

This is one of my **first projects** in React, and I'm sharing it now as part of documenting my learning journey.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React (via [your setup, e.g., Vite or CRA])
- JavaScript
- CSS (basic styling)
